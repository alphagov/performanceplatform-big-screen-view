# Performance Platform big screen view

This project is a JavaScript application for displaying data from
the Performance Platform fullscreen on a large display, for example
in building receptions and offices.

The style was inspired by @demotive's [gds-performance-slides](https://github.com/Demotive/gds-performance-slides) ([available on Heroku](https://gds-screens-slides.herokuapp.com/)).
